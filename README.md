# Largest-BST-In-Binary-Tree
The code determines the size of the largest Binary Search Tree (BST) within a given binary tree. It does this by using a recursive, post-order traversal (helper function) that checks if each subtree is a valid BST. The function returns information about the subtree, including its size and the minimum and maximum values, to find maximum BST size.
